# Codeforces-Solutions
This repo is just a list of my Codeforces submissions. Thank you for visiting <3
## Effectiveness of my code
Even though all of my solutions in this repository are all ACCEPTED by the Codeforces Judging System, I cannot guarantee that they are optimal, and they may fail under contraints different from that of Codeforces problem statements.  
## Problem statements
I have decided to not include problem statements as they are all well-documented on the Codeforces website. I will only be providing brief statements for some problems.
